1. Boolean expressions are evaluated from left to right (the same in Java),
    so it is totally OK to write code like 

        if(a < x.size() && x[a]){
            ...
        }

    where `x` is a vector.

2. There is no `&&=` and `||=` operators in C++,
    instead you can use `&=` and `|=`.
    Though `&=` and `|=` are not specially for boolean values, 
    they work perfectly for boolean values.

3. If the numbers you work with support infinity or NaN, 
    boolean expressions become tricky. 
    For example, suppose `nan` is a varialbe representing Nan,
    both `2 < nan` and `2 >= nan` return `false`,
    which is not what we want. 
    A safer way is to first check whether numbers involved are NaNs. 
    Hopefully, ternary boolean type will be introduced into C++ in future.
