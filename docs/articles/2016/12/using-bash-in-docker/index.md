If the docker container was started using `/bin/bash` 
(you can check using `docker ps`) command you can access it using `attach`. 
```bash
docker attach container_name_or_id
```
If the docker container was started but not with `/bin/bash`,
you have to create a bash instance inside the container using `exec`.
```bash
docker exec -it container_name_or_id /bin/bash 
```
Notice that `attach` does not create a new instance of bash 
but use the already created one in the corresponding docker container.
However, 
both `exec` and `run` create new bash instances.

## Examples
```
docker exec -it -u dclong jupyterlab-py jupyter nbconvert --to html --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 /workdir/spend.ipynb 
```
