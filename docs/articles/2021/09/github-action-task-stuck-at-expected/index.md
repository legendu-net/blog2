1. The simplest manually solution is to close the PR and reopen it.

2. In my case, 
    the issue was due to `GITHUB_TOKEN` was used for the GitHub Action
    [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request)
    .
    Creating a repository secret 
    and use it to authenticate the GitHub Action
    [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request)
    resolved the issue.
