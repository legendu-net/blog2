1. Dropbox won't sync files that you don't have read permissions.

2. You'd better not merge an old Dropbox folder while installing/configuring Dropbox.

3. You'd better not store symbolic links in the Dropbox folder,
    because the symbolic links will be replaced by the real files/folders 
    when synchronized to other computers.

4. It is not a good idea to put a Git repository into Dropbox.
    First, 
    a Git repository usually contains lots of small files 
    which downgrades the performance of Dropbox.
    Second, 
    it is better to push a Git repository to GitHub, GitLab, etc.
