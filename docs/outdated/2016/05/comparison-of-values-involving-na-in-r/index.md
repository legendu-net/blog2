The best way to compare values containing `NA` in R is to define customized comparison functions.
Here is an example.
```R
equals = function(x1, x2, na_as_na = FALSE, reverse = FALSE) {
    if (reverse) {
        return(!equals(x1, x2, na_as_na, reverse = FALSE))
    }
    if (na_as_na) {
        return(x1 == x2)
    }
    ifelse(
           is.na(x1), 
           ifelse(is.na(x2), TRUE, FALSE), 
           ifelse(is.na(x2), FALSE, x1 == x2)
       )
}
```
