1. It is suggested that you use the package `stringi` instead of string utilities in R base. 
    There are multiple reasons.
        
        - stringi has consistent namings and signatures
        - the behavior of functions in stringi is more reasonable from engineering perspective


## Regular Expression

1. Use `$1` instead of `\\1` to capture the nth capture group,
and similarly for other capture groups.
