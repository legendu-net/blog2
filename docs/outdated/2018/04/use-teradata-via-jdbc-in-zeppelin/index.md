## Use Teradata in Zeppelin

In order to connect Teradata via jdbc, a few things are needed to config the jdbc interpreter for Zeppelin:

1. Set default.user, default.password

2. Set default.url to `jdbc:teradata://server_ip`

3. Import Teradata JDBC driver into Dependencies (the .jar package is attached)

4. Set default.driver to com.teradata.jdbc.TeraDriver
