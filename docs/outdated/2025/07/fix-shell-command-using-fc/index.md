[Fish Shell]( https://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/tips-on-the-fish-shell ) 
is preferred to Bash/Zsh.
The following content is for Bash/Zsh only.


[fzf.history](https://github.com/legendu-net/icon/blob/dev/utils/data/bash-it/plugins/custom.plugins.bash#L149)
is a better alternative to `fc`'s core functionality (edit and re-execute command).

## Tips & Traps

1. In Linux shells like Bash and Zsh, 
    `fc` is a built-in command that stands for "Fix Command".
    Its primary purpose is to let you edit and re-execute commands 
    from your history using `$EDITOR`.

2. `fc -l 1` might throw the error `-bash: fc: history specification out of range` in bash
    (some people say that this won't be an issue in zsh as zsh is smart enough to handle specification out of range but I haven't verified it yet)
    if the (absolute) first bash history command has been pruned (due to large number of history commands).
    `HISTTIMEFORMAT="" history | sed -E 's/^[ ]*[0-9]+[ ]*//'` is a more robust command for the same purpose.
