As is know to all,
it can be dangerous to use the `rm` command directly in Linux/Unix.
A simple idea is to define other commands/alias/script to replace it.
For example,
I have a shell script named `trash` which moves files (as input arguments) to the system's Trash directory.

```
trash files_to_remove
```

Another even simplier way is to directly move files to the directory `/tmp`.

```
mv files_to_remove /tmp
```
