**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

Snap app is not 
(and [will probably never be](https://bugs.launchpad.net/snappy/+bug/1841327)) 
compatible with Docker by default.
However, 
there are some hackings to make snap app to work in Docker.
Also, 
[Kata Container](https://katacontainers.io/)
is a good (lightweight, container-like performance) VM alternative to Docker
if you do not like limitations and potential security issues of Docker.
