## Symtom

High disk and memory spill when doing shuffle.

## Cause

Insufficient executor memory (you can monitor this spill metrics from Spark UI).

## Solution

1. Increase executor memory.

   ```
    ::bash
    --executor-memory=4G
   ```

1. For jobs that do not need to persist data in memory
   we can reduce the cache storage size and enlarge the memory portion for shuffle.

   ```
    :::bash
    --conf spark.shuffle.memoryFraction=0.4 
    --conf spark.storage.memoryFraction=0.1 
   ```
