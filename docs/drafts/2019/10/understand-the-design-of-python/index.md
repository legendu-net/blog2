## Design

1. There is no constant variables in Python.
    If you need a constant variable in Python,
    just define one and never change it.
    It is suggested that you use UPPER_WITH_UNDERSCORE naming style for const variables in Python.
    There is no private variables/method in Python either.
    You can change/call any variable/method in a module/class.
    However,
    members that start with a single underscore (`_`) are considered as private by convention
    and you should avoid using them directly.

2. The bottom-most package in Java should be a file in Python.
    Do not use inner classes in Python.
    Just put classes in the same module.

3. Python is a dynamic language and thus does not support function/method overloading.
