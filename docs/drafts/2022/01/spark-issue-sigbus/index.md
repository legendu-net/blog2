## Symptoms

> CalledProcessError: Command './pine' died with \<Signals.SIGBUS: 7>.

## Possible Causes

SIGBUS (bus error) is a signal that happens
when you try to access memory that has not been physically mapped
.
There are several things which might cause a SIGBUS error.

1. Memory alignment issues with the CPU,
   e.g.,
   trying to read a long from an address which isn't a multiple of 4.

1. Access memory region that was once file-backed,
   but the original file got truncated in the iterim.
   For example,
   \- device failure
   \- A NFS was used and the network disconnected
   causing memory mapped file on the NFS failed to load.

## Possible Solutions

1. In the context of Spark/PySpark,
   the first cause usually happens if you call C/C++ code
   which uses pointers to manipulate memory.
   Fix memory miss alignment issues in the C/C++ code if any.

1. In thecontext of Spark/PySpark,
   the second cause is more likely than the first one
   and it typically means a device failure or network disconnection.
   You can simplfy retry your Spark/PySpark application.
   If you still encounter the same issue,
   try with increased `spark.executor.memory` and `spark.driver.memoryOverhead`.
   If your Spark application consists of a few big jobs,
   try splitting big jobs into smaller ones might also help.
