## Installation on Ubuntu

You can install the latest stable version of neovim using the command below.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable
    wajig update
    sudo apt install neovim

## Tips and Traps

1. AppImage is a good way to install the latest version of NeoVim.

2. [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) is a great configuration for NeoVim.

3. NeoVim with a complicated configuration (e.g., AstroNvim, SpaceVim, etc) 
    might be too slow when editing a large (>50M) text file.
    One trick helps is to disable plugins when editing large files.
    For example,
    you can use the following command to edit a large file without loading plugins.

        :::bash
        nvim --noplugin /path/to/large/text/file
