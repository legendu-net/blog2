## Python 

### [continuumio/miniconda3](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/miniconda3)

- It is hard to figure out the version of Python from the version of the Docker image.

### [continuumio/anaconda3](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3/)

- It is hard to figure out the version of Python from the version of the Docker image.

### [Python](https://hub.docker.com/_/python)

- Different versions of Python with the Debian Linux OS in Docker image.
- Easy to figure out the version of Python from the version of the Docker image.
    It is perticularly good if you need a specific (especially old) version of Python. 

### [dclong/python](https://hub.docker.com/r/dclong/python)

- Python 3.8 with Ubuntu 20.04 in Docker.

- Extra useful Python packages 
    (e.g., [xinstall](https://github.com/dclong/xinstall),
    mypy, pylint, yapf, pytest and ipython)
    installed.

- Extra essentiall tools (SSH, Git, Wajig, sudo etc.) installed.

- Ready for development and serve as the ancester image for 
    [dclong/jupyterhub-ds](https://github.com/dclong/docker-jupyterhub-ds)
