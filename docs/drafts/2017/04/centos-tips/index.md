1. The `wheel` group is the `sudo` group.
    So to grant a user the sudo previlege,
    just add it to the `wheel` group.

        :::bash
        gpasswd -a user_name wheel

## EPEL

    :::bash
    sudo yum -y install epel

## IUS Release

    :::bash
    sudo yum -y install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
