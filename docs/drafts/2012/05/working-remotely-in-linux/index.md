## From Linux to Linux

### Command Line Mode Using `ssh`

1. Using X forwarding, you can also run GUI applications on the server.
   This is not recommended unless it's short quick work.

### Remote File System

- nfs

  - NFS has better performance (compared to sshfs and samba)
    but it's less secured.

- sshfs

  - You'd better use a mount point which you have full access to,
    otherwise, you have use the root user to access the mount point.

  - You'd better add yourself to the `fuse` (which is required by sshfs) group.

- samba
