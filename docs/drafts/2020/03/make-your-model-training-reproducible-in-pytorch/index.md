**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

The PyTorch doc 
[Reproducibility](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html)
has very detailed instructions on how to make your model training reproducible.
Basically,
you need the following code.

    :::python
    torch.manual_seed(args.seed)
    np.random.seed(args.seed)
    random.seed(args.seed)

Notice that `torch.manual_seed` set seeds of RNGs on all devices (both CPU and GPUs).
There is no need to make additional calls of `torch.cuda.manual_seed`
or `torch.manual_seed_all`.
