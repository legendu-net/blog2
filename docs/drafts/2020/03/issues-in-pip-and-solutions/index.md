## Abort trap: 6 when using `pip3 search`

The issue is due to to `pyopenssl` using old dependencies.
It can be fixed by removing the Python package `cryptography` package
and then upgrading `cryptography` to version 2.8.

1. Find the location of the Python package cryptography.

   ```
    :::bash
    pip3 show cryptograph
   ```

1. Remove the whole package directory.

   ```
    :::bash
    sudo rm -rf /path/to/cryptograph
   ```

1. Reinstall the latest version of `cryptograph`.

   ```
    :::bash
    pip3 install cryptograph
   ```
