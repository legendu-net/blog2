**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

It is suggested that you leverage CICD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions)
instead of Git Hooks which happens locally.
However,
Git hooks can be useful for simple and fast local code formatting.

## Quick Start

1. Install pre-commit.

   ```bash
    pip3 install pre-commit
   ```

1. Edit `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
   Below is an example of of leveraging pre-commit
   to automate local linting and formatting for Python projects.

   ```
    :::yaml
    fail_fast: true
    repos:
    - repo: local
        hooks:
        - id: system
            name: pylint
            entry: poetry run pylint template_python
            pass_filenames: false
            language: system
    - repo: local
        hooks:
        - id: system
            name: pytype
            entry: poetry run pytype template_python
            pass_filenames: false
            language: system
    - repo: local
        hooks:
        - id: system
            name: yapf
            entry: poetry run yapf -r template_python
            pass_filenames: false
            language: system
   ```

1. Install the git hook scripts.

   ```bash
    pre-commit install
   ```
