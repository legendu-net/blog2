## Docker 1.13+

Docker 1.13+ mounts the container's cgroup to /sys/fs/cgroup (this could change in future versions).
You can check the limit using

```
:::bash
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes
```

## Older Version of Docker

1. Install [cgroup-tools](https://github.com/mk-fg/cgroup-tools).

   ```
    :::bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install cgroup-tools
   ```

1. Query the memory limit of the Docker container.

   ```
    :::bash
    cgget -n --values-only --variable memory.limit_in_bytes /
   ```

Notice that if a memory limit is not,
both of the above methods will return a extremely large number.
So to be safe,
you'd take the minimum value before the above result and the memory of the host
which can be get from the file `/proc/memoinfo`.
