## Tips and Tricks 

1. The Anker Home Backup Battery System automatically decides when to charge based the time-of-use schedule.

2. A F3800 plus battery has to be disconnected from the Anker Home Power Panel 
    before doing firmware update.

3. Use only one F3800 plus battery for system self-test. 
    Once the system self-test is done, 
    just connect the other F3800 plus battery (if you have 2 F3800 batteries).

4. Switch off breakers on the Anker Home Panel before plugging/unplugging batteris.

5. F3800 plus batteries can be added as devices in the Anker app
    but BP3800 extension batteries cannot be directly added as devices.
    A BP3800 extension battery shows up under the F3800 battery that it connects to in the app.

6. If battery capacity is an issue,
    you can

    - Add BP3800 expansion batteries.
    - Leverage manual override to charge batteries.
        Notice that manual override is one-time only.
    - Configure 10am - 5pm (off peak) as super off-peak in the app
        to fool the system to charge between the 2 peak periods.
    - Use an EV to charge batteries if necessary during a power outage.
        Notice that the batteries cannot supply power to the house 
        while they are being charged.

7. The Anker app supports at most 6 time frames for time-of-use. 
    If you this becomes a limit to you,
    you can remove the last super off-peak time frame (11pm - 12pm).
    This gives you the flexibility to hack other time frames. 
    For example, 
    you can split an off-peak time frame into an off-peak time frame and a super off-peak time frame 
    to fool the sytem to do more charging.
    Even if you do need such a hacking,
    this can still provides a couple of benefits.

    - Easier to set up time-of-use in the app.
    - Cleaner as there's one fewer time frame in the app.
