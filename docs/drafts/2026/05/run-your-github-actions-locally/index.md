## [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)

### Installation (Linux / macOS)

```sh
brew install act
```

### Trigger Workflows Listening on Pull Request

```sh
act pull_request
```

## [wrkflw](https://github.com/bahdotsh/wrkflw)

Wrkflw has a great TUI
which makes it easy to selectively run workflow and insepct results.
However,
wrkflw currently maps the ubuntu-latest VM to the ubuntu:latest Docker image
which are not compatible.
This causes many GitHub Actions workflow fail to run with wrkflw.
