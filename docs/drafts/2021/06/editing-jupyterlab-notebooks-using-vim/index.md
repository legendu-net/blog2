## Vim Inside Jupyter/Lab Notebooks

### [Firenvim](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim)

[Firenvim](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim)
turns your browser into a NeoVim client
which means that you can use it to interact with Jupyter/Lab notebooks using NeoVim.

### [jupyterlab-vim](https://github.com/jwkvam/jupyterlab-vim)

[jupyterlab-vim](https://github.com/jwkvam/jupyterlab-vim)
is a JupyterLab extension which brings Vim keybindings to cells of JupyterLab notebooks.
It can be installed using the following command in JupyterLab 3+.

```
:::bash
pip3 install jupyterlab_vim
```

And it can be uninstalled using the following command.

```
:::bash
pip3 uninstall jupyterlab_vim
```

By default,
a JupyterLab extension is enabled after installtion.
You can disable an extension,
e.g., jupyterlab_vim, using the following command.

```
:::bash
sudo jupyter labextension disable @axlair/jupyterlab_vim
```

And enable it again using the command below.

```
:::bash
sudo jupyter labextension enable @axlair/jupyterlab_vim
```

## Jupyter/Lab Notebooks Inside / Paired With Vim

### [vim-jukit](https://github.com/luk400/vim-jukit)

[vim-jukit](https://github.com/luk400/vim-jukit)
is a REPL plugin and Jupyter-Notebook alternative for Vim and Neovim
.
It is currently the best solution
to edit Jupyter/Lab notebook in Vim.

### [jupytext.vim](https://github.com/goerz/jupytext.vim) + [iron.vim](https://github.com/hkupty/iron.nvim)

This approach is similar to vim-jukit
but its user experience is not as good as vim-jukit.

### [magma-nvim](https://github.com/dccsillag/magma-nvim)

[magma-nvim](https://github.com/dccsillag/magma-nvim)
enables you to interact with Jupyter/Lab notebooks from NeoVim.
