The best way to "recover deleted files"
is really to avoid permanently delete files.
It is suggested that you avoid using the `rm` command
(unless you are 100% sure what you are doing)
.
Insted,
you can use a file manager provided by a Linux desktop to delete files.
This way, 
deleted files are moved to the Trash directory,
which can be recovered easily.
If you must use a command-line tool,
it is suggested that you use one of the following safer alternatives to `rm`.

- [rip](https://github.com/nivekuil/rip)
- [trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli)
- [%trash magic for IPython](https://github.com/legendu-net/icon/blob/dev/utils/data/ipython/startup.ipy#L111)

## Recover Files Using `extundelete`

```bash
sudo mount -o remount,ro /dev/sdb1
sudo extundelete --restore-all /dev/sdb1 
```
