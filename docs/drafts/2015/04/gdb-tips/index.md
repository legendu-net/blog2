**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

1. lines use : while functions use ::

2. use relative path from the executable to implementation files!!!

        :::gdb
        b ../../tree.cpp:31 if knot->name()=="GO:0006139"

3. it seems that there is a bug in GDB? 
    Sometimes the results of running an executable directly and within GDB are different!
