@TODO: make a general discuss about removing elements form containers ...

vector -> best to remove backwards ...

You cannot erase elements from a container 
using the function `std::for_each` 
or the range-based for loop (introduced in C++11).
It is easy to make mistakes while you erases elements using iterator in C++.


the following discussion is for set only

Suppose `numbers` is a container with integer number,
and we want to erase the even numbers from it.
The following code is a correct way to do this.

```C++
for(auto it=numbers.begin(); it!=numbers.end(); ){
    // copy the current iterator then increase it
    auto cit = it;
    ++it;
    if((*cit) % 2 == 0){
        // won't invalidate iterator it, 
        // because it is already pointing to the next element
        numbers.erase(cit);
    }
}
```
