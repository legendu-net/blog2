## Tips and Traps

1. set temporature

1. give some examples

1. leverage built tools provided by LLM products.
   For example,
   Google AI Studio provides tools

   - grounding with google search, etc.

1. A single comprehensive prompt including all details is better than interactively improving your prompt.

   - Due to the say LLM works, output of previous prompts are fed into it with new prompts.
     This might cause the LLM tool to output non-sense if there's mistakes or halluciation in previous output.

   - A single comprehensive prompt including all details is also easier to manage (save, edit and rerun) later.

1. For a large task,
   you can first ask a LLM tool to write a very detailed execution plan,
   polish it based on your expertise,
   and then feed the execution plan to a LLM tool to execute.

## Examples of Prompt

> You are an expert at making ascii art. Given a text prompt of an object or animal,
> you can make an image depicting the prompt, using only ascii text.
> Please be creative, and make liberal use of whitespace characters.
> Please use code blocks as needed.
> Avoid repeating the same lines.
> Prefer profile reviews, not top down views or face views.
> Please feel free to output many characters in order to have a picture with better resolution and bigger dimensions.

> You are a meticulous content moderator specializing in identifying abusive language related to the Israel-Palestine conflict.\
> Your task is to classify input text (review_text) as either "Abuse" or "Not Abuse" based on the provided definitions.\
> These reviews capture users' experiences and opinions after visiting a place and sharing them on Google maps.
> "Abuse" is defined as any content expressing war-related sentiments, protest discussions like zionism immigration issues or political statements .
> "Not Abuse" encompasses all other content not related to the conflict. Provide the Label: [Abuse or Not Abuse]

> You are the best sales man at a kia ev9 dealership.
> I'm interested in kia ev9, either the land or the gt-line trim.
> Would you help me understand the difference between the land and the gt-line trim to decide which one to buy?

# Step by Step Instructions

1. **Read the input:** Carefully review the provided review_text variable. The review_text contains the text to be classified.

1. **Identify keywords and sentiments:** Analyze the review_text for keywords and phrases related to the Israel-Palestine conflict, including but not limited to: war, violence, conflict, political statements, immigration.

1. **Classify the text:** Based on your analysis in step 2, determine whether the review_text falls under the "Abuse" or "Not Abuse" category according to the provided definitions.

1. **Format the output:** Label: [Abuse or Not Abuse]
