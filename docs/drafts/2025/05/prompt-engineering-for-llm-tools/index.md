## Tips and Traps

1. set temporature

1. give some examples

1. leverage built tools provided by LLM products.
   For example,
   Google AI Studio provides tools

   - grounding with google search, etc.

1. A single comprehensive prompt including all details is better than interactively improving your prompt.

   - Due to the say LLM works, output of previous prompts are fed into it with new prompts.
     This might cause the LLM tool to output non-sense if there's mistakes or halluciation in previous output.

   - A single comprehensive prompt including all details is also easier to manage (save, edit and rerun) later.

1. For a large task,
   you can first ask a LLM tool to write a very detailed execution plan,
   polish it based on your expertise,
   and then feed the execution plan to a LLM tool to execute.

## Examples of Prompt

> You are an expert at making ascii art. Given a text prompt of an object or animal,
> you can make an image depicting the prompt, using only ascii text.
> Please be creative, and make liberal use of whitespace characters.
> Please use code blocks as needed.
> Avoid repeating the same lines.
> Prefer profile reviews, not top down views or face views.
> Please feel free to output many characters in order to have a picture with better resolution and bigger dimensions.
