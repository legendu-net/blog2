## Tips & Traps

1. `fd` is much faster compared to `find`.

## Installation

    sudo apt install fd-find

The install binary is `fdfind`.

## Example Usages

1. Find all directories under `$dir`. 

        fdfind --type d . $dir 

2. Find all files under `$dir`. 

        fdfind --type f --print0 . $dir
