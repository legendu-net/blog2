## Configure The Shortcut `ctrl+x` `ctrl+e`

The shortcut `ctrl+x` `ctrl+e` edits a bash prompt using `$EDITOR` in terminals.
However,
this doesn't work out-of-the-box in the teminal in Visual Studio Code.
This is because by default `ctrl+e` is binded to the command\
`workbench.action.quickOpen`
which is among the list of commands skipping shell by default.
You can remove `workbench.action.quickOpen`
from the list so that `ctrl+e` is pass to the shell
by adding the following settings.

```
"terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell": [
    "-workbench.action.quickOpen"
]
```

This will enable the shortcut `ctrl+x` `ctrl+e` to edit a bash prompt using an external editor.
However,
if you are using Gitpod,
the shortcut will open a new tab to edit the bash prompt.
This is because the environment variable `VISUAL`
is set to `/ide/bin/remote-cli/gitpod-code` by default in Gitpod.
To make the shortcut `ctrl+x` `ctrl+e` editing a bash prompt
using your preferred editor (say, NeoVim),
make sure to set both environment variables
`VISUAL` and `EDITOR`
.
