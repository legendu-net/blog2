## Atomic Linux Distributions

### Fedora Atomic Linux Distributions

Open your terminal and run the following command to layer the package.
```
rpm-ostree install virtualbox-guest-additions
```

If you receive an error stating the package is "already provided" or part of the base image, 
run this command instead to explicitly enable it.
```
rpm-ostree install --allow-inactive virtualbox-guest-additions
```
