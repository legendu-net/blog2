Atomic Linux distributions (often called "immutable" distros) 
are a modern breed of operating system designed to be 
more reliable, secure, and maintainable than traditional Linux distributions.

## Some Good Atomic Linux Distributions

- [Universal Blue]( https://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/universal-blue-images-for-atomic-linux-distributions )
    - recommended 
    - based on Fedora Atomic distributions
- [Fedora Atomic](https://www.fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/)
    - personally prefer Fedora Kinoite
- [AerynOS](https://aerynos.dev/users/desktops/cosmic/)

## Package Managements for Atomic Linux Distributions

See 
[chat with Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts?state=%7B%22ids%22:%5B%221hUaLtZQXDzQeZwfjTkeBJzBWh0_DWpQk%22%5D,%22action%22:%22open%22,%22userId%22:%22100282891140280543929%22,%22resourceKeys%22:%7B%7D%7D&usp=sharing)

1. Core OS
    - Fedora Atomic: rpm-ostree
    - AerynOS: moss
2. GUI applications 
    - flatpak 
    - snap
    - AppImage
        - It can be a good choice if you need deep system access 
            but don't want to get into the hell of configuring using flatseal 
            (or a flatpak app doesn't even exist).
            For example, 
            it's a good choice for WeChat and terminal apps.
    - Distrobox / Toolbx
        - GUI applications might fail to launch
    - Virtual Machine Manager
        - based on KVM, great performance
        - the ultimate (but heavy) solution 
3. CLI utilities
    - Homebrew
    - [Distrobox / Toolbx](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts?state=%7B%22ids%22:%5B%221G2PCEp2tK5VUzgmEp70m2oHfkTysj1Q6%22%5D,%22action%22:%22open%22,%22userId%22:%22100282891140280543929%22,%22resourceKeys%22:%7B%7D%7D&usp=sharing)
4. Dev environment
    - Podman
    - Docker
