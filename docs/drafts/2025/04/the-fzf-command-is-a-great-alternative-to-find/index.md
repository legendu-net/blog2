## Example Usages

- [Some Useful Shell Functions - fzf](https://github.com/legendu-net/icon/blob/dev/utils/data/bash-it/custom.plugins.bash)

## Speed up `fzf`

1. By default, 
    `fzf` uses `find` to find files.
    A different command can be configured via the environment varialbe `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`.
    It is suggested that you use `fd`
    which is both more intuitive and way much faster.
