**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

There are many different ways to install packages in Linux.

1. Build from source.

2. Pre-built binaries.

3. Use distribution specific tools.
    For example,

    - [Debian, Ubuntu Series]( https://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/package-management-for-debian-and-ubuntu )
    - Fedora: dnf

    Notice that Atomic Linux distributions have their own version of package managing tools.
    For example,

    - Fedora Atomic: rpm-ostree
    - AerynOS: moss

4. [Homebrew](https://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/homebrew-tips) and
    [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/)
    are 2 popular package management tools for Linux
    when you do not have the root permission.
    Homebrew is preferred to Nix for multiple reasons.

    - Homebrew works for both macOS and Linux. 
        For people who have already been using Homebrew on macOS,
        there's no learning effort at all.

    - Homebrew has more packages.

5. Use cross‐platform and dependency‐free app formats,
    e.g.,
    [FlatPak](https://flatpak.org/)
    and 
    [AppImage](https://appimage.org/)
    .
    For the difference between FlatPak and AppImage,
    please refer to
    [What are the differences between snaps, appimage, flatpak and others?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/866511/what-are-the-differences-between-snaps-appimage-flatpak-and-others)
    .

6. Software management tools in Linux distributions.
    This is usually just a GUI for FlatPak or snap.
    However,
    it has integration with the desktop environment
    so that you don't have to start flatpk / snap apps using command line.
