**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**


## [indoc](https://github.com/dtolnay/indoc)
The
[indoc](https://github.com/dtolnay/indoc)
crate provides a procedural macro for indented string literals. 
The `indoc!()` macro takes a multiline string literal 
and un-indents it at compile time 
so the leftmost non-space character is in the first column.

## [compact_str](https://crates.io/crates/compact_str)
The
[compact_str](https://crates.io/crates/compact_str)
crate
provides a memory efficient string type that transparently stores strings on the stack, when possible

## [memchr](https://crates.io/crates/memchr)
The
[memchr](https://crates.io/crates/memchr)
crate
provides extremely fast (uses SIMD on x86_64, aarch64 and wasm32) routines 
for 1, 2 or 3 byte search and single substring search.

## [bstr](https://crates.io/crates/bstr)
The
[bstr](https://crates.io/crates/bstr)
crate
provides a string type that is not required to be valid UTF-8.

## [arcstr](https://crates.io/crates/arcstr)
The
[arcstr](https://crates.io/crates/arcstr)
crate
provides a better reference-counted string type, 
with zero-cost (allocation-free) support for string literals, and reference counted substrings.


## [atoi-rs](https://github.com/pacman82/atoi-rs)
The
[atoi-rs](https://github.com/pacman82/atoi-rs)
crate
parses integers directly from [u8] slices in safe code
.

## [lazy_format](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_format)
[lazy_format](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_format)
is a [no_std] library for lazily formatting things,
which avoids allocating temporary strings 
when writing to a buffered stream. 

## [Askama](https://github.com/djc/askama)
[Askama](https://github.com/djc/askama)
implements a template rendering engine based on Jinja. 
It generates Rust code from your templates at compile time 
based on a user-defined struct to hold the template's context.

## [human_bytes](https://crates.io/crates/human_bytes)
[human_bytes](https://crates.io/crates/human_bytes)
converts bytes into human-readable values.

## [scraper](https://crates.io/crates/scraper)
[scraper](https://crates.io/crates/scraper)
provides HTML parsing and querying with CSS selectors.

## [semver](https://crates.io/crates/semver)
[semver](https://crates.io/crates/semver)
provides parser and evaluator for Cargo's flavor of Semantic Versioning.

## [jetscii](https://github.com/shepmaster/jetscii)
[jetscii](https://github.com/shepmaster/jetscii)
A tiny library to efficiently search strings for sets of ASCII characters 
and byte slices for sets of bytes.

## [fluent-rs](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs)
[fluent-rs](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs)
Rust implementation of Fluent 
which is a localization system
for natural-sounding translations.
