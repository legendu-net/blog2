The Rust crate
[backtrace-on-stack-overflow](https://crates.io/crates/backtrace-on-stack-overflow)
helps printing the stack backtrace
when your Rust program encounters stack overflow issues.

1. Add
   [backtrace-on-stack-overflow](https://crates.io/crates/backtrace-on-stack-overflow)
   as a dependency into your project.

   ```
    :::bash
    cargo add backtrace-on-stack-overflow
   ```

1. Add the line
   `unsafe { backtrace_on_stack_overflow::enable() };`
   into the beginning of your main function.

   ```
    fn main() {
        unsafe { backtrace_on_stack_overflow::enable() };
        /*
           your code ...
        */
    }
   ```

1. Run your project again.
